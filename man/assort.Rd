\description{
Assortativity coefficient is a measure of segregation for social networks
due to Mark Newman (2002).
}
\details{
The measure evaluates the relative prevalence of within-group ties. It is
based on the contact layer of the mixing matrix.

Assortativity coefficient is 1 if all ties are within-group.
The minimum can be negative, but not less than -1, and depends on the
relative number of ties of nodes in different groups. If the network
conforms to "proportionate mixing", the coefficient is 0.

If \code{object} is a table it is treated as a mixing matrix.
Two-dimensional table is interpreted as a contact layer. Three-dimensional
table is interpreted as a full mixing matrix \eqn{m_{ghy}}{m[ghy]}
cross-classyfying all dyads, in which 'g' and 'h' correspond to group
membership of ego and alter respectively. Layers y=1 and y=2 are assumed to
be non-contact and contact layers respectively. In the 3-d case only
\code{g[,,2]} is used.

If \code{g} is an object of class "igraph" the measure is
calculated for the vertex attribute specified with \code{vattr}.

For any other classes, object \code{g} are coerced to a table and the
table method is called.
