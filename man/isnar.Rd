\title{Introduction to Social Network Analysis with R}
\description{
Functions and data accompanying my workshop "Introduction to Social Network
Analysis with R".
}
\section{Terminological disclaimer}{


This package is about analyzing social networks. Social Network Analysis
(SNA) uses mathematical graph theory to represent its ideas. Nevertheless,
for, among other things, historical reasons SNA developed its own
terminology of networks that functions somewhat in parallel to
graph-theoretical terms. To clarify, these are the synonyms for strict
mathematical terms corresponding to graphs:
\describe{
\item{graph}{a collection of vertices and lines connecting them. Sometimes
called "network"}
\item{vertex}{sometimes called "node"}
\item{line, edge, arc}{sometimes called a (directed/undirected) "tie". Edge
starting point can be called a "tie sender" or "ego". Edge endpoint can be
called "tie receiver" or "alter"}
}
